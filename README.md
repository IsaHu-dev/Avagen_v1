### Logo 

[![Avagen Logo](media/avagen_logo_text.png)](media/avagen_logo_text.png)


The interface uses soft, neutral colors with a single eye-catching gradient ( #7F00FF → #17A2B8 → #E100FF) for buttons and key actions. This keeps the focus on the products page while still guiding users where to click. For typography, it uses Inter for body text and Space Grotesk for headings, creating a modern and readable design.

## Agile Process

Project tasks were tracked in **GitHub Projects** (Kanban). Each card contained a *user story* with acceptance criteria and links to the relevant pull request.
